### How to run
- fill .env file following .env.example
- run `yarn` to install dependencies and `yarn dev` to start development server
### Problems with this implementation
- the counter is hard coded and will reset with every deploy
- possible but not so likely collision
### Possible solution to problems
- have a dedicated server just for the counter(?)
